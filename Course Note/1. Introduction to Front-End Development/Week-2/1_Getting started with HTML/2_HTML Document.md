1. **Creating an HTML File**:
    
    - You can create and view HTML files locally on your computer without the need for a web server.
    - Using a code editor like Visual Studio Code, create a new file and name it "index.html."
2. **HTML Document Structure**:
    
    - HTML documents start with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, which specifies that it is an HTML document.
    - The `<html>` tag is the root element of the HTML document.
    - Inside the `<html>` tag, there are two primary elements: `<head>` and `<body>`.
3. **The `<head>` Element**:
    
    - The `<head>` element contains metadata and information about the web page but is not displayed on the page.
    - It typically includes the `<title>` element to set the title displayed in the browser tab.
    - Other metadata, such as linking to CSS files or defining Meta tags, can be added in the `<head>` section.
4. **The `<body>` Element**:
    
    - The `<body>` element contains the visible content of the web page.
    - You can add various elements within the `<body>`, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and videos.
5. **Adding Content**:
    
    - You can use HTML tags to structure and format content. For example, you used the `<h1>` tag for the main heading "Our Menu."
    - Subheadings were created using the `<h2>` tag, with the menu items "falafel" and "pasta salad."
6. **Viewing the Web Page**:
    
    - To preview your HTML file in a web browser, save the file and open it in your browser.
    - The content you added is displayed in the browser, with the title matching the one specified in the `<title>` element.
7. **Adding Descriptions**:
    
    - You can add additional details to your menu items by using the `<p>` (paragraph) tag to describe the ingredients.
8. **Practicing HTML Tags**:
    
    - You have learned some basic HTML tags and are encouraged to practice using them in your web pages.

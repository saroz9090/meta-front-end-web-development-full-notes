**Anchor Tag (a)**:

The `<a>` tag, also known as the anchor tag, is used to create hyperlinks on a webpage. Hyperlinks are clickable links that direct users to another webpage, a specific section of a webpage, a file, or an external resource.

- **How to Create a Hyperlink**: To create a hyperlink using the `<a>` tag, you use the `href` attribute to specify the destination URL or location. The text or content to be displayed as the link is placed between the opening and closing `<a>` tags.
    
    Example:
    
    htmlCopy code
    
    `<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>`
    
    In this example, when users click on "Visit Example Website," they will be directed to the URL "[https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com/)."
    
- **In Short**:
    
    - The `<a>` tag is used to create clickable links.
    - It uses the `href` attribute to define the link's destination.
- **Note**:
    
    - The `href` attribute can link to various destinations, including web pages, email addresses, document files, or specific sections within a page using anchor IDs.
    - To open a link in a new tab or window, you can use the `target="_blank"` attribute within the `<a>` tag.

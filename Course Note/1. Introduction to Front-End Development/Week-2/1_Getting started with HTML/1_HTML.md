1. **HTML's Origin**:
    
    - Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at CERN, started developing HTML in 1991.
    - HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, with "Hypertext" referring to text containing links and "Markup" involving tags and elements.
2. **HTML Files**:
    
    - HTML files are typically text files with the ".html" suffix, like "index.html."
3. **HTML Tags and Elements**:
    
    - HTML documents consist of elements and tags.
    - Elements are enclosed in angle brackets and define the structure and content of a web page.
    - An opening tag is represented as `<tagname>`, and a closing tag as `</tagname>`. Most elements have both.
    - Elements can contain content or other elements. For example, a paragraph element `<p>` can contain text.
    - Some elements are self-closing or empty, meaning they don't have a closing tag. They are written as `<tagname>` or with a forward slash before the closing angle bracket `<tagname/>`.
    - Elements can be nested, allowing for complex structures.
4. **HTML Standards**:
    
    - HTML specifications, which define the rules and structure for HTML elements and tags, are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
    - The current HTML version is HTML 5.
5. **HTML's Role in Web Pages**:
    
    - HTML elements build the structure of a web page and instruct the web browser on what to display.
    - HTML is responsible for defining the basic content and layout of a web page.
6. **CSS for Styling**:
    
    - While HTML defines the structure, to control the appearance and styling of web pages, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used. CSS is introduced as a separate topic.

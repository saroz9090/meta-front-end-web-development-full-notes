1. **Headings (h1 - h6)**:
    
    - These tags are used to define headings and subheadings on a webpage.
    - `<h1>` represents the main heading and is the most important, while `<h6>` is the least important subheading.
    - They help in structuring content and are used to create titles and subtitles.
2. **Paragraphs (p)**:
    
    - The `<p>` tag is used to create paragraphs of text.
    - It separates text content into blocks, making the content more readable and organized.
3. **Line Breaks (br)**:
    
    - The `<br>` tag is used to force a line break within text content.
    - It doesn't have a closing tag and is often used to separate lines of text when you want to maintain line breaks, like in poems or addresses.
4. **Strong**:
    
    - The `<strong>` tag is used to give importance to a section of text.
    - It typically makes the text bold and is used to emphasize important content within a paragraph.
5. **Bold (b)**:
    
    - The `<b>` tag is used to make text bold.
    - It's used for styling purposes but doesn't imply importance. It's often used for aesthetic reasons.
6. **Emphasis (em)**:
    
    - The `<em>` tag is used to add emphasis to text.
    - It typically makes the text italic and is used to emphasize text for semantic purposes. It implies a slight change in tone or stress.
7. **Italics (i)**:
    
    - The `<i>` tag is used to make text italic.
    - It's used for stylistic purposes, such as marking titles, phrases in other languages, or general text that should appear in italics.
8. **Lists (ul and ol)**:
    
    - Lists are used to group items in a specific order or without a specific order.
    - `<ul>` creates an unordered (bulleted) list, while `<ol>` creates an ordered (numbered) list.
    - `<li>` is used to define list items within both `<ul>` and `<ol>` lists.
9. **Div Tags (div)**:
    
    - The `<div>` tag is a container element used to group other HTML elements.
    - It's mainly used for structuring the layout and styling of a webpage with CSS. It doesn't have any specific visual impact by itself.
10. **Comments (<!-- -->)**:
    
    - Comments are not displayed on the webpage but are used for adding notes within the HTML code.
    - They are useful for explaining the purpose of specific sections of code to other developers or for future reference.

These tags play a crucial role in structuring and formatting the content of a webpage, making it visually appealing and semantically meaningful for both users and developers.

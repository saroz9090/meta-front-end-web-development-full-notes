**Web Accessibility Overview:**

- Web accessibility aims to ensure that everyone, regardless of disability, can access and interact with websites.

**Types of Disabilities Addressed:**

- Web accessibility covers a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, and speech impairments.
- Assistive technologies, such as screen readers and speech recognition software, help users with various disabilities access the web.

**International Standards:**

- The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) established international standards for web accessibility to create a more inclusive web experience.

**Examples of Accessibility Tools:**

- Screen reader software: Reads website content aloud for blind and visually impaired users.
- Speech recognition software: Converts spoken words into computer commands or text input for those with physical or neurological disabilities.
- Subtitles and video scripts: Provide assistance for users with audio and visual disabilities.

**Principles of Improving Accessibility:**

- Start thinking about accessibility from the beginning of a project, as retrofitting can be challenging.
- Use correct HTML structure and elements, like headings and paragraphs.
- Avoid using multiple line breaks for formatting, as it can hinder assistive technology.

**Complex Web Apps and ARIA:**

- For complex web applications, consider the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) specification, which offers techniques to enhance accessibility.

Web accessibility is crucial to ensure that the internet is usable and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. By following best practices and using the correct HTML structure, web developers can make their content more accessible to a broader audience.

## Libraries

Re-usable code                         Specific functionality                            Time saving

## Frameworks

Structure for development   (Blueprint)









## Key Points

- Frameworks and libraries are pre-existing tools used in software development to streamline and accelerate the development process.
- Libraries are specific, reusable pieces of code that provide solutions for particular functionalities, such as email validation, and can be used in applications.
- Frameworks offer a structured environment for application development, defining the overall structure and architecture, and developers customize them for their specific application's needs.
- Frameworks may use libraries to accomplish their tasks, and developers can include additional libraries as necessary.
- Frameworks are considered opinionated, enforcing a specific structure, while libraries are unopinionated and provide more developer freedom.
- The use of frameworks and libraries can significantly reduce development time, minimize errors, and allow more focus on essential application features.
- Choosing between frameworks and libraries depends on the project's requirements, with frameworks providing structure and libraries offering flexibility.

**Webpages are built using three main technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

1. **HTML (Content):** Think of it like the blueprint or framework of a car. HTML describes the structure and content of a webpage.
    
2. **CSS (Styling):** This is similar to the looks of a car. CSS defines how elements on a webpage should be positioned, sized, colored, and styled.
    
3. **JavaScript (Engine):** JavaScript acts as the engine of the webpage. It provides interactivity and functionality, making things move and respond to user actions, just like a car's engine powers it.

- **API Definition**: API stands for "Application Programming Interface. [It is a set of functions and procedures that enable applications to access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.]
    
- **API Types for Web Developers**:
    
    1. **Browser or Web APIs**: These are built into web browsers, extending browser functionality and simplifying complex tasks. Examples include the DOM API for manipulating web page structure and the geolocation API for obtaining device location.
        
    2. **RESTful (REST) API**: REST, or Representational State Transfer, is a set of principles for building efficient APIs. REST APIs send and receive data to/from centralized databases and are commonly used for web and mobile apps.
        
    3. **Sensor-Based APIs**: These APIs are part of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem and enable interconnected physical sensors to communicate, track, and respond to physical data, like smart lights and node bots.
        
- **Common RESTful API Actions**:
    
    - **GET**: Retrieve data.
    - **POST**: Create data.
    - **PUT**: Update data.
    - **DELETE**: Delete data.
- **API Design and Principles**: APIs follow REST principles and good design practices to create discoverable interfaces, ensuring that requests and responses are well-structured and predictable.
    
- **API Workflow**: APIs use endpoints specified in URLs to access different resources. The API processes requests server-side and generates responses, which can be full web pages or data in formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
    

As a web developer, you will frequently work with different types of APIs, extending system functionality, and acting as bridges between various components.

**Understanding Web Pages, Websites, and Web Applications**

- When doing things online, you encounter web pages, websites, and web applications. But what's the difference, and how do developers choose? Let's explore:
    
- A **web page** is like a single page in a book, made of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays text, images, and more in a web browser.
    
- A **website** is a collection of web pages linked under one domain. Think of it as a book with many pages. Clicking links takes you to different pages, all within the same website.
    
- Hyperlinks connect web pages, and they can lead to content on the same website or different ones. For example, search engine results are links to various websites.
    
- The distinction between a website and a **web application** is interactivity and dynamic content. A website is informative, like a company's site. In contrast, a web application, like food ordering, is interactive, displaying content based on user input and location.
    
- In summary, web pages make up websites, while web applications are interactive and dynamic, offering content based on user actions.
